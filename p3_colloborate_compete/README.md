# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

```
Number of agents: 20
Size of each action: 4
There are 20 agents. Each observes a state with length: 33
The state for the first agent looks like: [ 0.00000000e+00 -4.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00

  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 -1.00000000e+01  0.00000000e+00

### Distributed Training

For this project:
- We have 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

Here i use DDPG, that uses multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  

#### Goal

Agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,
- After each episode, add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  Take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30. 

### Getting Started
To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Clone the DRLND repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

3. Clone this repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karanjude/DeepRL.git
cd DeepRL/p2_continuous_control
```

4. Download Unity ML agent env

5. Start jupyter and run cells in Continuous_Control.ipynb to train the agent and evaluate the agent for 100 episodes
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
