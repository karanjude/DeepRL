# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.


```
Number of agents: 2
Size of each action: 2
There are 2 agents. Each observes a state with length: 24
The state for the first agent looks like: [ 0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.
  0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.
  0.          0.          0.          0.         -6.65278625 -1.5
 -0.          0.          6.83172083  6.         -0.          0.        ]
 ```

### Distributed Training

For this project:
- We have 2 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

Here i use DDPG, that uses multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience. Note, each agent congtributes to a global replay buffer, which is then used to train a global ddpg agent (actor + critic).

#### Goal

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

### Getting Started
To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Clone the DRLND repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

3. Clone this repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karanjude/DeepRL.git
cd DeepRL/p3_colloborate_compete
```

4. Download Unity ML agent env

5. Start jupyter and run cells in Tennis.ipynb to train the agent and evaluate the agent for 100 episodes
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
